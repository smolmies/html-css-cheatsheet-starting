This repository is the merge of the reference sheet and the website design system
project i have made on the Front-End Engineer course on Codecademy.

The reference sheet contains tables which i have filled up as a personal "cheat sheet"
about terms in the HTML, CSS and JS chapters of the course.
The website design system highlights the design aspects i have incorporated throughout
both of the pages.

Thanks for reading!

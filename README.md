# Reference Sheet and Website Design System

## Description:

This repository is the merge of the reference sheet and the website design system project i have made on the Front-End Engineer course on Codecademy.

The website design system highlights the design aspects i have incorporated throughout both of the pages.

*This project is still in development and updated frequently to add more content to the reference sheet.*

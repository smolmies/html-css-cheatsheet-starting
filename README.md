# Reference Sheet and Website Design System

## Description:

This repository is the merge of the reference sheet and the website design system project i have made on the Front-End Engineer course on Codecademy.


### General Info:

The reference sheet contains tables which i have filled up as a personal "cheat sheet" about terms in the HTML, CSS and JavaScript chapters of the course.
The website design system highlights the design aspects i have incorporated throughout both of the pages.


### Programming Languages:

+ HTML
+ CSS

#### View the Project:

Since the project is static i have activated Github Pages on it. You can view the project [here!](https://smolmies.github.io/reference-sheet-and-design/) 

*This project is still in development and updated frequently to add more content to the reference sheet or implement those items learned into its styling.*

**Thanks for reading!**
